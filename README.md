# High-Performance Custom Camera Framework

A ground-up implementation of a camera processing pipeline with custom memory management and hardware acceleration. This project prioritizes performance through direct hardware access and zero-copy operations.

## Core Technical Implementation

### 1. Custom Memory Management System
- **Zero-Copy Memory Pool** (`memory_manager.py`)
  - Direct memory mapping to GPU buffers
  - Pre-allocated aligned memory blocks
  - Custom buffer recycling system
  - Hardware-aligned memory transfers
  - Minimal allocation overhead during runtime

### 2. Direct Camera Access Layer
- **Raw Hardware Integration** (`camera_capture.py`)
  - Direct V4L2 implementation for Linux
  - Native AVFoundation bindings for macOS
  - Low-level DirectShow access for Windows
  - Bypasses OS abstraction layers
  - Direct memory mapping from camera to GPU

### 3. High-Performance Processing Core
- **Asynchronous Pipeline** (`performance_core.py`)
  - Zero-copy texture updates
  - Multi-threaded frame processing
  - Lock-free synchronization
  - Direct hardware acceleration
  - Custom thread pool implementation

### 4. OpenGL Integration
- **Custom GL Core** (`gl_core.py`)
  - Direct buffer mapping to GPU memory
  - Custom shader implementation
  - Asynchronous texture updates
  - Zero-copy rendering pipeline
  - Hardware-synchronized frame timing

## Technical Specifications

## Implementation Notes

This framework prioritizes performance through direct hardware access and custom implementations of typically abstracted components. By managing memory manually and implementing direct hardware access, we achieve minimal latency and maximum throughput in the camera processing pipeline.

The system is designed for applications requiring real-time camera processing with minimal latency and maximum throughput, suitable for high-performance computer vision applications.
